Public version of my dotfiles.

Will add things slowly, need to check which files have sensitive information and not share that.

I have 2 environments generally: for work and for home. This is because my work environment tends to be more restrictive and I might not be able to install everything I have at home. Also, work environment is WSL 1, as WSL 2 is not approved.
